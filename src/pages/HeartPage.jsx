          Your Heart: The Key to Your Life and Energy
        </h1>

        <p className="!text-blue-800 !mb-8 !text-center !text-lg">
          The heart is one of the most vital organs in the human body,
          responsible for keeping you alive and energized. Acting as a powerful
          pump, it circulates oxygen-rich blood to every cell, ensuring that
          your body functions smoothly. Whether you're resting, running, or
          experiencing emotions, your heart is constantly working behind the
          scenes to keep you going.

        <h2 className="!text-3xl !font-bold !text-blue-900 !mb-4">
          How Your Heart Works
        </h2>

        <p className="!text-blue-800 !leading-relaxed !mb-4">
          The heart is a strong, muscular organ about the size of your fist,
          located in the chest. It has four chambers that work together like a
          perfectly coordinated team to pump blood throughout the body. The
          right atrium receives oxygen-poor blood from the body, while the right
          ventricle sends this blood to the lungs to pick up oxygen. The left
          atrium then receives the oxygen-rich blood from the lungs, and the
          left ventricle—the strongest chamber—pumps this oxygenated blood to
          the rest of your body through a network of arteries.
        </p>

        <p className="!text-blue-800 !leading-relaxed !mb-8">
          The heart beats about 100,000 times a day, sending blood through
          60,000 miles of blood vessels! Its electrical system ensures that it
          beats in a coordinated manner, keeping you alive and active. This
          incredible organ generates enough energy daily to power a small car
          for 20 miles, working tirelessly without you even thinking about it.
        </p>

          How Your Heart Changes with Age
        </h2>

        <p className="!text-blue-800 !mb-6">
          As we go through different life stages, our heart undergoes
          significant changes in structure and function. Here's what happens at
          each stage of life.

          Before Birth (3-8 weeks): The Formation Stage
        </h3>

        <p className="!text-blue-800 !mb-4">
          The heart starts forming by the 3rd week of pregnancy and is fully
          developed by the 8th week. Special fetal structures help bypass the
          lungs until birth, making this the most critical period for heart
          development.

          Childhood (0-12 years): The Growing Engine
        </h3>

        <p className="!text-blue-800 !mb-4">
          The heart grows rapidly, adapting to the child's increasing energy
          needs. A newborn's heart beats much faster (120-160 beats per minute)
          compared to an adult's, gradually slowing as the child grows.

          The heart reaches its full size and efficiency, working at its peak.
          This is when lifestyle choices such as diet, exercise, and stress
          management start playing a crucial role in long-term heart health.

        <p className="!text-blue-800 !mb-4">
          The heart's pumping efficiency may decline slightly. Blood vessels may
          start to stiffen, and conditions like high blood pressure and
          cholesterol buildup can develop if unhealthy habits persist.

          The heart muscle may thicken, and blood vessels may stiffen further,
          making circulation less efficient. However, a healthy lifestyle can
          significantly slow these changes and maintain heart function well into
          old age.

          Common Myths About the Heart
        </h2>

        <p className="!text-blue-800 !mb-6">
          There are many misconceptions about heart health. Let's set the record
          straight with facts.
        </p>

        <h3 className="!text-xl !font-semibold !text-blue-900 !mb-2">

        </h3>

        <p className="!text-blue-800 !mb-4">
          Young adults can also develop heart problems due to poor lifestyle
          choices, genetics, or chronic stress. Prevention should start early!
        </p>

        <h3 className="!text-xl !font-semibold !text-blue-900 !mb-2">
          Myth: If you have a strong heart, you don't need to exercise
        </h3>

        <p className="!text-blue-800 !mb-4">
          Regular exercise keeps your heart muscle strong and prevents future
          heart problems. Even a healthy heart needs consistent activity to stay
          in peak condition.
        </p>

        <h3 className="!text-xl !font-semibold !text-blue-900 !mb-2">

        <p className="!text-blue-800 !mb-4">
          Heart attacks can also cause nausea, jaw pain, shortness of breath,
          fatigue, and pain in the arms or back. Symptoms can vary greatly
          between individuals.

          this life-sustaining organ.

          It Pumps 2,000 Gallons Daily
        </h3>

        <p className="!text-blue-800 !mb-4">
          Your heart pumps about 2,000 gallons of blood every day through 60,000
          miles of blood vessels. That's enough blood to fill a small swimming
          pool every single day!
        </p>

        <h3 className="!text-xl !font-semibold !text-blue-900 !mb-2">
          It Responds to Your Emotions
        </h3>

        <p className="!text-blue-800 !mb-4">
          Your heart beats faster when you're excited, in love, or stressed.
          This is because emotions trigger the release of hormones that directly
          affect your heart rate and blood pressure.

        </h3>

        <p className="!text-blue-800 !mb-6">
          Your heart doesn't need your brain to tell it to beat! It has its own
          electrical system that keeps it beating even if it's disconnected from
          the nervous system.

          How to Keep Your Heart Healthy
        </h2>

        <p className="!text-blue-800 !mb-4">
          Taking care of your heart is essential for a long and active life.
          Here are the most effective ways to maintain cardiovascular health:
        </p>

        <h3 className="!text-xl !font-semibold !text-blue-900 !mb-2">
          1. Eat a Heart-Healthy Diet
        </h3>

        <p className="!text-blue-800 !mb-4">
          Focus on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Include
          omega-3 fatty acids found in fish, nuts, and seeds while avoiding
          excess salt, sugar, and unhealthy fats. Foods rich in antioxidants
          like berries and dark leafy greens help protect your heart from
          damage.
        </p>

        <h3 className="!text-xl !font-semibold !text-blue-900 !mb-2">
          2. Stay Physically Active
        </h3>

        <p className="!text-blue-800 !mb-4">
          Engage in at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise most days of the
          week. Walking, swimming, cycling, and dancing are all excellent for
          heart health. Strength training and yoga can also benefit your
          cardiovascular system by improving circulation and reducing stress.
        </p>

        <h3 className="!text-xl !font-semibold !text-blue-900 !mb-2">
          3. Manage Stress Effectively
        </h3>

        <p className="!text-blue-800 !mb-4">
          Chronic stress can damage your heart by raising blood pressure and
          increasing inflammation. Practice deep breathing, meditation, or
          mindfulness to help manage stress. Getting enough sleep (7-9 hours per
          night) also allows your heart to recover and repair.
        </p>

        <h3 className="!text-xl !font-semibold !text-blue-900 !mb-2">
          4. Avoid Harmful Substances
        </h3>

        <p className="!text-blue-800 !mb-4">
          Smoking damages blood vessels and significantly increases heart
          disease risk. Excessive alcohol consumption can raise blood pressure
          and contribute to heart problems. If you smoke, quitting is the single
          best thing you can do for your heart health.
        </p>

        <h3 className="!text-xl !font-semibold !text-blue-900 !mb-2">
          5. Regular Health Monitoring
        </h3>

        <p className="!text-blue-800 !mb-6">
          Keep track of your blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and blood sugar
          through regular checkups. Early detection of issues can prevent
          serious complications. Know your family history and discuss your risk
          factors with your healthcare provider.
        </p>

        <h2 className="!text-2xl !font-semibold !text-blue-900 !mb-3">
          Important Note
        </h2>

        <p className="!text-blue-800">
          Your heart is a powerhouse, working tirelessly every second of your
          life. By making smart lifestyle choices and being mindful of your
          heart's health, you can ensure it keeps beating strong for years to
          come. Show your heart some love—after all, it's the reason you're
          alive! Small changes today can lead to a lifetime of better heart
