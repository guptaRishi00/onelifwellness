          Your Gut: The Key to Your Overall Well-Being
        </h1>

        <p className="!text-blue-800 !mb-8 !text-center !text-lg">
          Your gut is more than just a digestion center—it's the foundation of
          your overall health. Often called the "second brain," your gut houses
          trillions of bacteria that influence digestion, immunity, mood, and
          even brain function. A well-balanced gut microbiome can lead to better
          energy, improved mental clarity, and a stronger immune system.

        <h2 className="!text-3xl !font-bold !text-blue-900 !mb-4">
          How Your Gut Works
        </h2>

        <p className="!text-blue-800 !leading-relaxed !mb-4">
          The digestive system is a complex network of organs that work together
          to break down food, absorb nutrients, and eliminate waste. Think of it
          as a sophisticated processing plant that runs 24/7 to keep your body
          functioning optimally.
        </p>

        <p className="!text-blue-800 !leading-relaxed !mb-8">
          Starting from your mouth where digestion begins with chewing and
          saliva, food travels through the esophagus to your stomach—a
          powerhouse of acids and enzymes. The small intestine then absorbs most
          nutrients with help from the liver, pancreas, and gallbladder.
          Finally, the large intestine hosts billions of beneficial bacteria
          that digest fiber, produce vitamins, and regulate immune function.
          Each section plays a crucial role in maintaining your overall health
          and well-being.

          The Gut-Brain Connection
        </h2>

        <p className="!text-blue-800 !leading-relaxed !mb-8">
          Did you know that 90% of serotonin (the happiness hormone) is produced
          in the gut? The gut and brain communicate constantly through the
          gut-brain axis, influencing mood, stress levels, and cognitive
          function. When your gut is healthy, you feel more balanced and
          energized. However, an unhealthy gut can contribute to anxiety,
          depression, and even neurological disorders. This incredible
          connection is why your gut is often called your "second brain."

          How to Keep Your Gut Healthy
        </h2>

        <p className="!text-blue-800 !mb-4">
          Maintaining a balanced gut isn't complicated—it starts with simple
          lifestyle changes that can have profound effects on your overall
          health:
        </p>

        <h3 className="!text-xl !font-semibold !text-blue-900 !mb-2">
          1. Eat a Diverse, Fiber-Rich Diet
        </h3>

        <p className="!text-blue-800 !mb-4">
          Include plenty of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and legumes.
          Consume fermented foods like yogurt, kimchi, sauerkraut, and kombucha
          to boost beneficial bacteria. Limit processed foods, excess sugar, and
          artificial sweeteners, which can harm your gut microbiome and promote
          inflammation.
        </p>

        <h3 className="!text-xl !font-semibold !text-blue-900 !mb-2">
          2. Stay Properly Hydrated
        </h3>

        <p className="!text-blue-800 !mb-4">
          Drinking enough water promotes healthy digestion, nutrient absorption,
          and detoxification. Adequate hydration also helps maintain the
          protective mucus lining in your intestines, which supports beneficial
          bacteria and prevents harmful substances from entering your
          bloodstream.
        </p>

        <h3 className="!text-xl !font-semibold !text-blue-900 !mb-2">
          3. Manage Stress Effectively
        </h3>

        <p className="!text-blue-800 !mb-4">
          Chronic stress disrupts gut bacteria and can lead to digestive issues.
          Practice deep breathing, meditation, yoga, or regular exercise to keep
          your gut-brain connection strong. Even short daily relaxation
          practices can significantly improve your gut health.
        </p>

        <h3 className="!text-xl !font-semibold !text-blue-900 !mb-2">
          4. Prioritize Quality Sleep
        </h3>

        <p className="!text-blue-800 !mb-4">
          Poor sleep weakens the gut barrier and leads to inflammation and
          digestive problems. Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep per night. Your
          gut bacteria follow circadian rhythms too, so consistent sleep
          patterns help maintain a healthy microbiome.
        </p>

        <h3 className="!text-xl !font-semibold !text-blue-900 !mb-2">
          5. Use Antibiotics Wisely
        </h3>

        <p className="!text-blue-800 !mb-8">
          Antibiotics kill both good and bad bacteria, leading to imbalances.
          Only use them when prescribed by a healthcare provider, and consider
          taking probiotics during and after antibiotic treatment to help
          restore your gut microbiome more quickly.
        </p>

        </p>

        <h3 className="!text-xl !font-semibold !text-blue-900 !mb-2">
          Saccharomyces boulardii
        </h3>

        <p className="!text-blue-800 !mb-4">
          Helps with IBS symptoms and reduces gut inflammation.
        </p>

        <p className="!text-blue-800 !leading-relaxed !mb-8">
          Get probiotics through fermented foods like yogurt, kefir, kimchi, and
          miso, or choose a high-quality multi-strain supplement. Pair
          probiotics with prebiotic foods (garlic, onions, bananas, asparagus)
          to help them thrive in your gut.
        </p>

          The Effects of Antibiotics on Gut Health
        </h2>

        <p className="!text-blue-800 !leading-relaxed !mb-4">
          Antibiotics are lifesaving medications, but they can disrupt gut
          health by killing not just harmful bacteria but also beneficial gut
          microbes. This can lead to digestive issues, weakened immunity, and
          long-term imbalances in gut flora that may take months to fully
          restore.
        </p>

        <h3 className="!text-xl !font-semibold !text-blue-900 !mb-2">
          Common Side Effects
        </h3>

        <p className="!text-blue-800 !mb-4">
          Diarrhea or constipation, bloating and gas, weakened immunity, food
          intolerances, and yeast infections are common after antibiotic use.
        </p>

        <h3 className="!text-xl !font-semibold !text-blue-900 !mb-2">
          Recovery Steps
        </h3>

        <p className="!text-blue-800 !mb-8">
          Take probiotics during treatment, eat prebiotic-rich foods, reduce
          sugar and processed foods, stay hydrated and eat fiber, and be
          patient—recovery takes time.
        </p>

        <h2 className="!text-2xl !font-semibold !text-blue-900 !mb-3">
